\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes a practical one-pass algorithm to compute the
Tucker decomposition of a tensor with provable guarantees.
Our algorithm uses a dimension reduction map to summarize the data in a linear sketch.
This sketch can be efficiently stored or transmitted, which enables applications in modern large-scale setting, including streaming and distributed data storage, or computational environment with limited memory.
We give the first comprehensive error analysis for one-pass Tucker decomposition algorithm in \ref{thm:low_rank_err}
and \ref{thm:fix_rank_err} for the tensor
approximation with error growing only linearly with the order $N$ of the tensor. In practice, our algorithm significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art one-pass Tucker decomposition algorithm \cite{malik2018low} in the limited memory setting and noisy setting with much greater stability. Also, our one-pass achieves the same performance in \cite{malik2018low}'s suggested setting when the memory requirement is much higher than our suggested setting.
Our algorithm is available as an open-source python package.
