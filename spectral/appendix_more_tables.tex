\section{Appendix: Additional Table and Graphs}\label{appendix:more_tables}
This section contains a table on precision, recall and F1 measures of the three different types of thresholding methods in selecting the non-zero entries of the spectral density matrices of VMA and VAR models of different dimension using different  sample sizes. The simulation settings are described in Section \ref{sec:simulation}. 

We also present enlarged images of the adjacency matrices of coherence networks obtained using adaptive lasso thresholding and shrinkage methods on the real data analysis in Section \ref{sec:realdata}. These images contain names of brain regions so that interesting strong connectivity patterns between regions can be identified easily.
