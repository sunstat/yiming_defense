andom projections reduce the dimension of data in form of vectors or matrix while preserving structural information, such as distances between vectors in the set. 
This paper proposes a novel use of row-product random matrices \cite{rudelson2012row} in random projections which we call Tensor Random Projection (TRP). It requires substantially less memory than existing dimension reduction maps.
The TRP map, formed as the Khatri-Rao product of several smaller random projections, is compatible with any basic random projection including sparse maps, which enable dimension reduction to realize at very low query costs without performing floating point operations. Theories of application of vector dimension reduction, matrix sketching, tensor regression have been built and tested through comprehensive simulation studies. We also experiment our methods in real scenarios with computer vision data.
