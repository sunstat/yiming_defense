\section{Conclusion}
The TRP is a novel dimension reduction map composed of smaller DRMs.
Compared to its constituent DRMs, it significantly reduces
the requirements for randomness and for storage.
% and computation cost (number of access to database), % XXX not sufficiently justified
Numerically, the variance-reduced TRP(5) method with only five replicates
achieves accuracy comparable to the conventional RPs for $1/20$ of the original storage.
We prove the TRP and TRP(T) are expected isometries with vanishing variance,
and provide a non-asymptotic error bound for the order 2 TRP.

and develop the theory relevant for the application of the TRP

(shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:sketching}).
