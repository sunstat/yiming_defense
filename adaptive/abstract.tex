Spectral density matrix estimation of multivariate time series plays a key role in time series and signal processing. Solid progresses have been made in estimating spectral density under high dimensional setting, in particular, with weak sparsity assumption. In this paper, we propose a data driven adaptive thresholding estimation method for spectral density matrix of Guassian process where we propose to do adaptive thresholding for real and imaginary parts separately. We propose a new modified peridogram which enjoys the same order of bias compared to periodogram. Also the modified periodogram has a simple variance expression which assists us in developing a solid theory.
