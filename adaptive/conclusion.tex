\section*{Conclusion}
We propose to do adaptive thresholding for weakly sparse spectral density estimation. In order to conquer some technical difficulties, we have proposed a new modified periodogram, which has the same order in bias compared with the classic periodogram, while providing great convenience in theoretical development. Our adaptive thresholding relaxes the constraint in maximum operator norm  and achieves better convergence rate in theory.
