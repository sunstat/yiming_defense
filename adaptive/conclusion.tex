\section*{Conlusion}
We propose to do adaptive thresholding for weakly sparse spectral density estimation. In order to conquer some technical difficulty, we propose a new modified periodogram, which has the same  order in bias compared to the classic periodogram, while provides great convenience in theoretical development. Our adaptive thresholding relax the constraint in maximum operator norm  and achieve better convergence rate in theory.
